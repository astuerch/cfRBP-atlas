# cfRBP-atlas
This repository contains all the scripts used for the manuscript:

"The cfRBP Atlas: Mapping Cell-Free RNA and RNA-Binding Protein Interactions in the Extracellular Space."

The scripts are organized by figure, ensuring a clear workflow for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

Special emphasis is given to 5_Script_cfRBP_footprint_pipeline.sh, which contains the pipeline used to identify cfRNA-RBP footprints based on our RBP knockout (KO) data. This script is essential for reproducing the cfRNA footprint analysis presented in the study.
